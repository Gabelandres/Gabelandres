HELLO!

My name is Gabriel Constantine Belandres but you can call me gaby.

I'm currently an undergrad at West Visayas State University currently attending the BSCS course.
I don't have a lot of experience with coding yet but I wish to learn and improve so that hopefully I can make use of it.
I'm quite proficient with English though in terms of writing since I have consumed a wide variety of medias ranging from video games to novels to who knows what from the internet.

I might want to pursue a career making games but as it stands right now I do not have the skills nor the knowledge to make that a reality.
I don't have a lot of social media accounts but I do have a facebook and a twitter I rarely visit and use.
